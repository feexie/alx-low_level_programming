0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to:
Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
Your program should print a number, followed by a new line
2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter:
Write a program that prints all arguments it receives.
All arguments should be printed, including the first one
Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line
3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument:
Write a program that multiplies two numbers.

Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line
You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer
If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1

4. To infinity and beyond:
Write a program that adds positive numbers.

Print the result, followed by a new line
If no number is passed to the program, print 0, followed by a new line
If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1
You can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an int
